# DataMining_Lab3
This is the 3rd Lab of the Data Mining course at my home university.

The lab covers the following topics:
Task 1: Time series anomaly/discord detection
Implements Matrix Profile to find unusual patterns (discords) in a time series.

Task 2: Elastic distance measures (DTW and Weighted DTW)
Implements a generic dynamic programming framework to calculate elastic distances between time series.

Task 3: Time-series forecasting with lagged and exogenous features
Builds features for supervised learning forecasting and performs multi-step iterative prediction.
